# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
The React client lives in `src`, with UI broken out under `src/components` and shared media in `src/assets`. Entry points (`src/index.js`, `src/App.js`) wire routes and global styles from `index.css` and `App.css`. Static files served by Create React App stay in `public`, and the email relay for the contact form is provided by `server.js` at the project root.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Install dependencies with `npm install` (or `yarn install` if you prefer Yarn). Run the SPA locally via `npm start`, which launches the CRA dev server on port 3000. Production bundles are generated by `npm run build`, and you can validate UI logic interactively with `npm test`. Start the mail proxy for form submissions using `node server.js` from the repo root.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Write React components as functions, exporting them from PascalCase files inside `src/components` (e.g., `Hero.js`). Use camelCase for local variables and hook names, and keep CSS modules flat under `App.css` unless a component requires scoped styles. Default formatting follows the Create React App ESLint profileâ€”run `npx eslint src` before opening a pull request if you add custom rules.

## Testing Guidelines
Unit and integration tests belong alongside code as `*.test.js` files (see `src/App.test.js` for patterns). Use React Testing Library queries to assert rendered behavior and avoid implementation-specific selectors. Execute `npm test -- --watch` while iterating, and capture coverage snapshots with `npm test -- --coverage` before release branches.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Use imperative, concise commit subjects (`Add carousel autoplay toggle`) and include a short body when context is useful. Pull requests should describe user-facing changes, list key screenshots for visual updates, and reference any related GitHub issues. Ensure lint, build, and test commands pass locally before requesting review.

## Security & Configuration Tips
Populate `EMAIL_USER` and `EMAIL_PASS` in a local `.env` file instead of editing `server.js`; never commit credentials. If the contact endpoint needs to run in production, place the server behind HTTPS and configure CORS to the deployed frontend hostname. Rotate Gmail app passwords immediately after testing shared changes.
